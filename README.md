This is my take on TicTacToe in C++. I am aware of popularity of this beginner project,
but I did not follow any guide or check the internet for ready solutions.

Note: This code does not represent my current programming skills. I've done it as an exercise after
completing first out of three parts of Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming - Principles and Practise using C++"
as an exercise. My skills keep improving.

TO DO:
- functions should not contain console output code, I need to change that
